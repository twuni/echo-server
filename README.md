The Concept
===========

Any currency must have perceived value in order to be useful for trading. For an item that does not in itself have value (such as paper money, coupons, or tickets),
its usefulness for trade somewhere comes from its ability to be traded for something else, somewhere else.

ECHO is a currency that is backed by text. You earn ECHO by typing a message to the server. This message can say anything you want. In return for your contribution,
the server will provide you with an ECHO token of a value equal to the amount of text you contributed. You, or anyone else, can trade any ECHO token at this server
for an amount of text equal to its value. This text is sourced entirely from contributions made to this server.


How does it work?
=================

Text is just like any other commodity like precious metals, oil, or food. There is a limited quantity of it, and any chunk of text is worth roughly the same as any
other chunk of text. Anybody can produce text, but mining ore, drilling for oil, and growing food all require specialization and risk. Text is the perfect Internet
commodity because it's cheap, it encourages participation, and it provides an anonymous venue for self-expression. The mystery of what gem might be revealed when
redeeming an ECHO token adds to the allure. The more interesting the submitted text is, the more valuable ECHO will be as a currency.

ECHO tokens inherit the qualities of Digital Cash (divisibility, durability, and portability) while adding the fourth quality of intrinsic value.
